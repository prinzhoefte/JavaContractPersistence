# Kaufvertrag â€“ DB & XML Java Project

This is a school project that focuses on implementing data persistence for purchase contracts using both a relational database (SQLite) and XML files. The project follows a specific architecture designed to ensure extensibility through the use of design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and DAO.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the persistence of contract partners and goods while not persisting the actual purchase contract itself. The architecture allows for easy integration of additional persistence methods in the future.

## Tasks

Here are the key tasks to be accomplished for this project:

1. **Implement the Prescribed Architecture**: Utilize the provided diagrams and theoretical concepts to implement the specified architecture.

2. **Persistence Implementation**: Implement data persistence for both SQLite database and XML files.

3. **Pair Programming**: Work in pairs, following the Pair Programming principle, with roles exchanged every 90 minutes. Each pair should handle either the persistence of goods or contract partners, persisting data in both the database and XML.

4. **Console Application**: Develop a console-based application to control and demonstrate the functionality of the persistence operations.

5. **Coding Guidelines**: Adhere to the coding style guidelines discussed in class, including naming conventions, commenting, and code indentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Review the provided architecture diagrams and relevant theory materials.

3. Implement the persistence logic for SQLite and XML as described in the project tasks.

4. Collaborate with your team members and use Pair Programming to efficiently complete the tasks.

5. Create a console program that showcases the functionality of your persistence implementation.
